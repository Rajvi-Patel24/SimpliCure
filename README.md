* Introduction
  
This project was developed during my first year of Computer Science Engineering as my first web development project.  
It represents my initial learning phase in front-end development and helped build a strong foundation in web technologies.
SimpliCure is a front-end web application developed as part of a innovative assignment.  
The project focuses on spreading awareness about health, sanitation, clean water access, and medical services through a simple and user-friendly website and this website is basically made on the refernce of huge public gatherings (like ujjain mahakumbh).
